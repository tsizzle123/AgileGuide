# Intro

# 1. What is Waterfall? 
Waterfall is exactly as it says, a linear and constant flow. When developing with Waterfall, things tend to be more stringent. Testers do not see the end product until it is 100% done. Waterfall leads to bureaucracy hold ups, flow bug fixes, and tends to stick to the initial design, no matter what.  

The core principal of waterfall is following the steps outlined at the begining of the development process. [This diagram illustrates the flow](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/0075636a-267f-4d14-93f5-4e4f53dba908/edit?page=0_0&invitationId=inv_a86c91a3-9f9b-47e8-b54c-99868ea6e6e7#)

The main attraction to waterfall is the clear answer for legacy systems and processes. Waterfall makes its name when things are easily predicatble and constant. Every step of the way is followed to a tee. The key to success in waterfall is properly outlining the requirements in advance. Because everything is locked into place once a step begins, errors occur when there is no SME for the system. 

Waterfall has traditionally been used by Governments and Financial Institutions because of the clear cut requirements and consistent tech stack. Utilizing the same systems, with the same constraints, for the same clients, allows for waterfall to flow. 

# 2. Where does Waterfall need some help?
What makes waterfall fall short is when things are not as clear. 

For example, if we are developing a new solution with a new product from Salesforce. This product has some documentation and examples from Salesforce, but the team is completely new to creating a solution with the product. 

If this new product does not work EXACTLY as we expect, waterfall begins to fail. Since the project was scoped out 6 months prior based on this product, we cannot create changes as the entire flow is dependent. If the product has idiosyncrasies we did not account for, the development process can be immediately thrown out of whack. 

The burden then falls on the development team to respond quickly to find a solution. This usually means late nights and weekends in order to stay on the timeline proposed to the customer. 

If there is any level of ambiguity in the development work, Waterfall is almost guaranteed to cause greater issues than it solves


# 3. What is Agile?
Agile is a method developed to overcome the pitfalls of waterfall's immutable nature. Agile focuses on the people and how they interact, rather than sticking to a stringent design document.
